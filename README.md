Assignment 1

    Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.
    Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. 

Assignment 2

    Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
